The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack gamification app, Le Lapin Blanc, using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Initial work focused on core UI and mock data, but faced persistent Optimization tab and data persistence issues. A major pivot occurred, first attempting mobile app conversion, then removing all narrative elements (story, artifacts, journal) to replace them with social features (Friends/Club, Map, Titles). The AI engineer meticulously refactored the frontend, fixed critical display bugs (ESLint, theme import, duplicate components), and implemented ELO into player stats. The most recent work involved building a robust backend authentication system, which was successfully tested, and integrating static data models for a new attack/defense and titles system. The trajectory ends with the engineer preparing to add FastAPI endpoints for these attack mechanics.

<product_requirements>
The user requested Le Lapin Blanc, a gamification application where players level up by completing missions, gaining XP, and improving stats. The application initially featured a narrative about a missing scientist and an immortality drug, but this was later completely removed. The current core requirements are:

*   **Gamification Core**: Missions with recurrence, custom categories, XP rewards/penalties, infinite progression, health/energy mechanics, and an automatic daily reset system.
*   **Stats**: Each player stat (Travail, Sport, Création, Lecture, Adaptabilité) includes an ELO rating (initial 1200, K=32, public visibility).
*   **UI/UX**: Single-page Terminal/Laboratoire layout, brighter/contrasting colors, missions displayed as tags/cards with full description modals, a floating mini-agenda/calendar for missions, and stylized icons.
*   **Online/Offline Mode**: User accounts with unique usernames, simple email/password authentication, and the ability to sync local and server data.
*   **Social Features**: New tabs for Ami/Club (player search, friend stats, club creation/joining), Carte (empty for now), and Titres (displaying achievements).
*   **Attack/Defense System**: A card-based system where players gain random attack/defense cards per level. Attacks penalize other players' stats/ELO, are applied immediately, appear to victims at midnight/login, are limited to one per stat per day, and prevent defending the attacked stat.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the robust backend authentication system for the Le Lapin Blanc application. This included implementing secure user registration, login, profile retrieval, and user search functionalities within  using FastAPI. The system now supports unique usernames, hashes passwords with , and utilizes JWT tokens for secure sessions. This entire authentication backend was thoroughly tested and confirmed as fully functional.

On the frontend, the ELO rating system has been successfully integrated visually, with ELO: 1200 displayed next to each player stat. The previous narrative elements have been completely removed, and new empty tabs for Ami / Club, Carte, and Titres are in place, ready for their respective UI development.

The user then provided comprehensive static data for 50 attack types, 10 defense badges, and player titles, including their effects and conditions. The AI engineer has begun the process of integrating these into the backend by creating data models and adding the static data structures directly within . The last action in the trajectory was to Maintenant remettons le code FastAPI et ajoutons les endpoints pour les attaques, indicating that the work is currently focused on building out the API endpoints to manage these attack mechanics.
